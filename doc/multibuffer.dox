@page contextptr Multi-Buffer Basics

Each writable data structure is multi-buffered, that is, each context points to
a potentially different version of the data. The data is copied on write (COW)
on the first write (non-const) access. The pointers to each data item are stored
in a lock-free vector to allow for wait-free run-time context creation and
destruction. The lock-free vector is loosely based on "Lock-free Dynamically
Resizable Arrays. Damian Dechev, Peter Pirkelbauer, and Bjarne Stroustrup".

The Context stores the index to access the per-context data item. The index is
either a direct pointer or an index (byte or short) to a pointer list. The
second approach is an optimization to minimize memory overhead when buffers are
shared. The optimized algorithm will only be implemented if memory overhead
turns out to be an issue. It has a higher complexity and requires more memory
allocations to keep the optimal size. Both algorithms are depicted in the Figure
on the right.

When writing to a structure which is referenced by more than one context, a copy
of the structure is made and set as the context copy. Therefore read and write
access from multiple contexts is thread-safe, access from multiple threads to a
single context data item is not.

<pre>
read value
    Context context = getCurrentContext();
    return *_values[ context ];

write value
    Context context = getCurrentContext();
    const Value* value = _values[ context ];
    if( value->getRefCount() > 1 )
        value = new Value( *value );
        _values[ context ] = value;
    *value = input
</pre>
